Welcome to My Fitness Buddy User Guide!  

Just enlisted under PES ‘B’ Pending and worried about the next few months of Basic Military Training (BMT)?  
Worry no more, My Fitness Buddy is here to accompany you through BMT and help you keep track of your weight loss journey!  
This user guide serves to provide you with the necessary instructions on how to set up and use our application. With that said, let’s get started!    

Choose a topic from the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) below.

## 1. Introduction
(Contributed by Hope)  
### 1.1 Application Overview
My Fitness Buddy `v1.4` is a desktop application that helps you to track your overall change in fitness level by allowing you to add daily records of your weight and calorie input/output.  
My Fitness Buddy also allows users to create a profile and can generate visual charts based on these records so that you can monitor your daily progress and help you achieve your goals.  
This application is optimized for use through a *Command Line Interface (CLI)*, meaning that you operate the application by typing commands into a command box.

### 1.2 Target Audience
My Fitness Buddy is designed for PES ‘B’ Pending (BP) soldiers who have just enlisted and are starting their initial 10 weeks of fitness training in BMT. Our features revolve around providing a visual and convenient way to keep track of factors that affect weight loss.  

We have also implemented a commander's version that would allow commanders to have an overview of all recruits.
### 1.3 Rationale
 Before this application was developed, PES BP soldiers had weekly weighing and had to record down their weights on a form kept by their commanders. This method was not only time consuming, it was also ineffective in tracking the soldiers' overall fitness levels. For instance, if a soldier's weight did not decrease over the weeks, he would be unable to pinpoint the reason why this is so.   
 My Fitness Buddy was developed so that soldiers would be able to see the fluctuations in their fitness level through factors such as calorie intake from consumption, calorie output from exercise, and daily weight records. Those records would be available by day and can even be viewed as  a graph.  
 We hope that through the use of this application, soldiers can take charge of their own fitness and achieve the results they strive for.

and their corresponding meaning.

Prefix | Meaning
--------|------------------
**tp/** | `type of calorie`
**t/** | `time`
**f/** | `food`
**e/** | `exercise`

can be used instead_

number of records for each category_

### 4.4 Data Visualization
(Contributed by Jun Hui)

Commands in this section are useful to view the graphical representations of the
daily weights and calorie input/output records generated by My Fitness Buddy.

These features help you to monitor your daily progress easily and allows you to understand
certain trends so that you can make better choices during your weight loss journey!

#### 4.4.1 View all calorie inputs and outputs of a day: `view`
(Contributed by Ethan)

Shows a list of all entries of calorie inputs and calorie outputs of a particular day.
Updates the status bar above to show you the date of the day you are viewing. 

Format: `view INDEX`

Main screen before a view command is used:

![day_before_view](images/dayBeforeView.png)

Main screen after a view command is used:

![day_after_view](images/dayAfterView.png)

_:warning: Calorie lists will not show anything if you have not added any calorie
inputs or outputs for that particular day you are viewing. The status bar will still 
update._ 

_:bulb:TIP: Calorie lists can be viewed alternatively by double clicking on a particular day card._

#### 4.4.2 View Statistics: `stats`
(Contributed by Jun Hui)

Shows the charts generated from the daily entries of weight and calorie input/output in a pop-up window.

Format: `stats v/CHART_TO_BE_VIEWED`

You can select which charts to view:

Prefix/Parameter | Meaning
-----------------|------------------
**v/all**        | `Shows both weight and calorie charts`
**v/calorie**    | `Shows calorie chart only`
**v/weight**     | `Shows weight chart only`

Example: `stats v/all`

This command will display both charts in their respective pop-up windows.

_:bulb:TIP: You can hover your mouse over the data point to see the actual value_

Weight Chart:
![weight_stats_chart](images/weight_stats_chart.png)
Calorie Chart:
![calorie_stats_chart](images/calorie_stats_chart.png)

_:bulb:TIP: Charts can be viewed alternatively by going to the menu bar, click on `Statistics` and select the 
 chart that you want to view._

![chart_menu_bar](images/chart_menu_bar.png)

#### 4.4.3 Personal related data visualisation:
(Contributed by Wa Wai)

On top of the various data analytical tools to visualize the various statistic over the training period, we also
have a number of indicators and diagrams to help the user get a better grasp on their current fitness level
##### 4.4.3.1 Current BMI
![BMI](images/calorieImages/BMI.png)

In the current profile, we have a small BMI label which will indicate the current BMI level of the user. 
It will update accordingly to the user's latest weight entry and give them their most updated BMI reading.

##### 4.4.3.1 Calorie Budget
![calorie_budget](images/calorieImages/calorie_budget.png)

As shown in the diagram , each day entry will indicate the calorie budget for the day. (The amount of calorie the
users can consume before gaining weight) It will update accordingly when various calorie entries are recorded to remind
the users how much calorie they can afford to eat for that particular day.

![positive_calorie_budget](images/calorieImages/positive_calorie_budget.png)

When there is calorie budget surplus, which means that the users can still afford to consume calorie without gaining
weight, a green tick will be shown at the top right corner of the day entry.

![negative_calorie_budget](images/calorieImages/negative_calorie_budget.png)

However when there is negative calorie budget, the users cannot afford to consume calorie as they are gaining
weight, a red cross will be shown at the top right corner of the day entry.


##### 4.4.3.1 Progress Bar

The progress bar indicates how close the users are towards the healthy Bmi range. When the user lose weight and
have a healthier bmi, the blue bar will move towards the right. When the progress bar is completely filled,it
indicates that the user has reached the healthy BMI range.

![progress_bar](images/calorieImages/progress_bar.png)

As shown from the diagram, the progress bar changes accordingly when the user's weight changes.


### 4.5 General commands

graphical representations, so you and other commanders can have a better insight to your training
effectiveness.

#### 4.6.1 View overall BMI progress of the recruits: `stats v/commander`
Shows a pie chart that classifies all the recruits (with their profiles existing in the app) into different BMI categories.
