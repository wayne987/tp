## Project: My Fitness Buddy

My Fitness Buddy is a desktop application that helps PES B pending recruits keep track of their
overall change in fitness level by allowing them to add daily records of their weight and calorie input/output.  
           
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: View command
Added a view command for the ability to view calorie inputs and calorie outputs for a specific day.
* What it does: allows users to view all calorie inputs and calorie outputs for a particular day when a view command is used
* Justification: This feature is a core feature of the product as a user should be 
able to see their calorie inputs and outputs of a day that they have recorded. 
* Highlights: There were some initial difficulty with figuring out how the Ui 
elements work and what causes the list to update itself. I had to also figure out 
the design of my implementation without affecting the design of the architecture.   
                   
Added additional functionality of allowing users to view calories by clicking on the Day card instead. 

* **New Feature**: Double clicking on a DayCard would allow you to view calorie inputs and calorie outputs that particular day.
Justification: Allows users an additional way to view their daily calories.
