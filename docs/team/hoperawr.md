## Project: My Fitness Buddy

My Fitness Buddy is a desktop application that helps PES B pending recruits keep track of their
 overall change in fitness level by allowing them to add daily records of their weight and calorie input/output.  
           
Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=hoperawr)

* **Project management**:
  * Handled the entire storage system and storage test cases which included the creation of 5 new classes to handle 
  the new and constantly changing features of the application (Pull requests

  [\#159](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/159))
  * Solved various bugs throughout the project. (Pull requests

  [\#222](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/222))
  * Removal of redundant code and refactoring of names. (Pull requests 
  [\#133](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/133), 
  [\#224](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/224))
  
* **New Feature**: Update Profile [\#139](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/139)
    * What it does: allows the user to update their profile after creation.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes when creating their profile and be allowed to edit it.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and classes.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Changed the implementation of the add feature to add it by date [\#103](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/103)
  * Changed the implementation of the calorie feature to add it by time [\#103](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/103)
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage. (Pull requests 
  [\#233](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/233), 
  [\#242](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/242))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Changed existing User Guide to fit v1.2 of our application [\#33](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/33)
    * Edited the Introduction, Application Overview, Target Audience, Rationale, About, Using his User Guide
     , Symbols and Syntax and Command Format. Also created a logo for the application. (Pull requests 
     [\#106](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/106),
