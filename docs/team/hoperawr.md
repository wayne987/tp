## Project: My Fitness Buddy

My Fitness Buddy is a desktop application that helps PES B pending recruits keep track of their
 overall change in fitness level by allowing them to add daily records of their weight and calorie input/output.  
           
Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=hoperawr)

* **Project management**:
  * Handled the entire storage system and storage test cases which included the creation of 5 new classes to handle 
  the new and constantly changing features of the application (Pull requests [\#76](), [\#133](), [\#159]())
  * Solved various bugs throughout the project. (Pull requests [\#76](), [\#111](), [\#112](), [\#222]())
  * Removal of redundant code and refactoring of names. (Pull requests [\#133](), [\#224]())
  
* **New Feature**: Update Profile [\#139]()
    * What it does: allows the user to update their profile after creation.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes when creating their profile and be allowed to edit it.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and classes.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Changed the implementation of the add feature to add it by date [\#103]()
  * Changed the implementation of the calorie feature to add it by time [\#103]()
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage. (Pull requests [\#233](), [\#242]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Changed existing User Guide to fit v1.2 of our application [\#33]()
    * Edited the Introduction, Application Overview, Target Audience, Rationale, About, Using his User Guide
     , Symbols and Syntax and Command Format. Also created a logo for the application. (Pull requests [\#106](), [\#153](), [\#247](), [\#252]())  
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the Storage package in Developer Guide.
    * Added the details of CalorieCommand to the list of features which includes the creation of two diagrams [\#262]()

* **Community**:
  * Handle the organisation and delegation of duties within the team.
  * Merged numerous PRS
  * Documented bugs for other teams during PE
