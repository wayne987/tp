## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 About the application

My Fitness Buddy `v1.4` is a desktop application that helps you to track your overall change in fitness level by allowing you to add daily records of your weight and calorie input/output.  
My Fitness Buddy also allows users to create a profile and can generate visual charts based on these records so that you can monitor your daily progress and help you achieve your goals.  
This application is optimized for use through a *Command Line Interface (CLI)*, meaning that you operate the application by typing commands into a command box.


### 1.2 Purpose

This document specifies the architecture, implementation and design decisions for
the application, My Fitness Buddy.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This Developer Guide is for anyone who are interested in the implementation of My Fitness Buddy,
as well as future developers that are interested in further developing of our application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2. Design**

### 2.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. 
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of these parts as described below with the respective class diagrams.
All these UI parts, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. 

The overall UI structure is decomposed from `MainWindow` into different class diagrams for better clarity.
* `MainWindow`

![Ui_Class_Diagram1](images/UiClassDiagram1.png)

* Profile Panels:
    * `ProfileCardPanel`
    * `ProfileListPanel`
    * `ProfileCard`
    
![Ui_Class_Diagram4](images/UiClassDiagram4.png)

* Day Panel:
    * `DayListPanel`
    * `DayCard`
    
![Ui_Class_Diagram3](images/UiClassDiagram3.png)

* Calorie Panels:
    * `CalorieInputListPanel`
    * `CalorieInputCard`
    * `CalorieOutputListPanel`
    * `CalorieOutputCard`
    
![Ui_Class_Diagram5](images/UiClassDiagram5.png)

* Pop-Out Windows:
    * `CalorieStatsWindow`
    * `WeightStatsWindow`
    * `CommanderBmiStatsWindow`
    * `HelpWindow`
    
![Ui_Class_Diagram6](images/UiClassDiagram6.png)

* Other UI elements:
    * `CommandBox`
    * `ResultDisplay`
    * `StatusBarDaySelected`
    * `StatusBarFooter`
    
![Ui_Class_Diagram2](images/UiClassDiagram2.png)

### 2.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `MyFitnessBuddyParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a day).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 2.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

The model stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences and stores My Fitness Buddy data.
The model also exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Day>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.  

`MyFitnessBuddy` is made up of a `UniqueDayList` which contains a list of `Day` objects. The `Day` class contains a `Date` and uses `CalorieManager` class as a data structure to store calorie `Input` and `Output`. `CalorieManager` also keeps track and can return the total calorie input and output. 

The `Calorie` class contains a `Time` and `CalorieCount` which `Input` and `Output` inherits from.  `Input` contains an additional `Food` while `Output` contains an addition `Exercise`.

`CalorieManager` is used by `Day` as a data structure to contain `Input` and `Output`. It also keeps track and can return the total calorie input and output. 

### 2.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagramNew.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save My Fitness Buddy data in json format and read it back.

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Feature: Add a new daily record

#### Implementation

This feature enables the user to add a new daily record which includes the daily weight.
Adding a new daily record allows the user to add specific calorie input/output entries into the app.

The mechanism utilises the `AddCommandParser` Class to parse the input into `Date` of `day.Date` Class
and `Weight` of `day.Weight` Class and a new `Day` object is instantiated.

It then utilises the `AddCommand` Class to add the `Day` through the `Model#addDay` method which will add the `Day`
into the `UniqueDayList`.

Below is a sequence diagram when the user executes `add d/2020-11-08 w/76` into My Fitness Buddy.

![Add_day_sequence](images/AddDaySequence.png)

### Remove Calorie feature

#### Implementation

This feature allows user to remove a certain calorie from a particular day.

The mechanism utilises the RemoveCommandParser Class to parse the input into `Type of Calorie` to be remove, `Date` of the
day in which the calorie is in and `Index` of the particular calorie to be removed in the list. 

It than utilise the RemoveCommand class to execute the actual removal of the calorie. It will call the method `getDate` which uses `Date` to locate the Day class
from the uniqueDayList in which the calorie resides in and returns it.

The CalorieManager of the particular Day class will then be retrieved using the `getCalorieManager` method to make the relevant changes. 
CalorieManager contains a list of Input Calories and a list of Output Calories.

Finally,`Type of Calorie` is then used to determined which list the calorie to be removed is in. It will utilise 
the CalorieManager method `removeCalorieOutput` or `removeCalorieInput` depending on `Type of Calorie`. The method will than use `Index`
to remove the calorie at the specific index in the corresponding list of Calories. 

![RemoveCalorieSequenceDiagram](images/RemoveCalorieSequenceDiagram.png)

### Feature: View Daily Weight and Calorie Statistics

#### Implementation

This feature allows users to view their daily calorie input, 
calorie output and weight in the form of a line chart generated using JavaFX
`LineChart` and `XYChart`. 

This feature can be executed using `stats v/calorie`, `stats v/weight`
or `stats/vall` commands to show either the calorie, weight or all charts respectively.
Given below is a sequence diagram when user executes `stats v/weight` command.

![stats_sequence_diagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

The mechanism utilises the `Logic#getFilteredDayList` method to get all
daily records of calorie input/output and weight to be used
as data points and axis of the chart. 

It also utilises JavaFX `ListChangeListner` to listen for any changes
to the list when the user adds or modifies any data, and updates the chart 
instantly.

This feature comprises the `CalorieStatsWindow` and `WeightStatsWindow` classes
and have the same behaviour, with the only difference is the type of data (calorie input/output, weight)
used to generate the chart. Given below is an activity diagram shows how the weight chart is being updated
when there is a change in `DayList`.

![weight_chart_activity_diagram](images/WeightChartActivityDiagram.png)

### Feature: View Overall Progress Statistic

#### Implementation

This feature allows users to view the overall BMI progress of the recruits
in the form of a pie chart generated using JavaFX `PieChart`.

The mechanism utilises the `logic#getFilteredPersonList` method to get all
the BMI values to be used as data for the pie chart.

It also utilises JavaFX `ListChangeListner` to listen for any changes
to the list when the user adds or modifies any data, and updates the chart 
instantly.


### View all calorie inputs and calorie outputs of a day feature

#### Implementation

This feature allows users to view each of their calorie inputs and calorie 
outputs for a particular day in a `ListView` when a view command is used.
The mechanism utilises the ViewCommandParser class to parse the input and get the 
`Index` of the particular day to be viewed.

It then utilises the ViewCommand class to display the correct message to the user,
depending on the validity of the `Index`. If the `Index` is valid, a CommandResult 
gets returned and the `MainWindow#handleView` gets called with the now zero-based 
`Index`. The `Index` is then used to get the `Day` from the `Logic#getFilteredDayList` 
method. The list of calorie inputs and calorie outputs of that `Day` would be then used 
to fill up the JavaFX `ListView`. The `ListView` is then used to replace the placeholders 
on the right side of the app in `MainWindow`. 

The JavaFx `StatusBar` will also get updated with the date of the `Day` viewed, using
the `MainWindow#setDateLabel` method. 

Whenever a new calorie gets added, the calorie lists will get automatically updated
using the `DayListViewCell#updateItem` method in `DayListPanel`.

The calorie lists can also be viewed by double clicking on a `DayCard`. When a `DayCard`
gets double clicked, the `Hbox#setOnMouseClicked` gets called and the lists and 
status bar gets updated similarly. 

Given below is the sequence diagram when a view command is used.

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

### Creates a new Person to My Fitness Buddy

#### Implementations

This feature allows users to create a new `Profile`, consisting of their *Name*, *ID*, *Height* and *TargetWeight*,
and a new `UniqueDayList` for daily calorie entries. Upon initialising My Fitness Buddy application, a default `Person` object 
will be created and its `Profile` will be recreated by users. Once the profile has been set for `Person`, the user can now add
daily entries to My Fitness Buddy's `UniqueDayList`. 

_{Diagram to be added}_

### Edits a profile in My Fitness Buddy

#### Implementations

This feature allows users to edit an existing `Profile`, consisting of their *Name*, *ID*, *Height* and *TargetWeight*.
`UniqueDayList` that records the daily entries will remain unchanged.

{More details to be added in terms of updating the profile in the next iteration}
